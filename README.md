# Analysing-Different-types-of-Graph using Matplotlib(Data Science).
This project is based on data Science .Here i have  used matplotlip data visualization librery of python.by using this librery we can generate <br />
1. simple graph <br />
2. bar graph and <br />
3.pie chart. <br />
The reason behind this project is sometime we use graph for mathematical analysis but to draw it on graph paper is not much attractive but by using this console based application you can draw accurately by giving the different value and you can do analysis of the same.i have attached code of the same.
